Thanks for visiting! I am a technology enthusiast and software developer, working primarily with javascript (node, react, angularjs) and the Microsoft dotnet ecosystem. While I'm a fan of all things tech, my main area of interest is education technology - more specifically, how we can unlock the power of the internet to create opportunity for people around the world.

Currently, I work full-time as a software developer. Previously, I worked as a program coordinator for an education-focused charitable foundation, specializing in developing grant opportunities related to online education and edtech. In the past, I've held positions as diverse as history/test prep/alternative school/afterschool teacher, field archaeologist, and pizza delivery guy and bartender when there were bills that needed paying. My hope is that, by sharing the (sometimes twisting and turning) route to my own developing interest in technology, I can help other people who may not have had the opportunity yet to explore their own passions. Ultimately, I am a lifelong learner with an interest in finding ways to build a more free and open society that empowers every individual to realize their full potential.
